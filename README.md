# About me :sunglasses:

I am a 4th-year `Computer science student on Warsaw University of Technology`, writing mainly in JavaScript and Python. I love creating frontend & backend applications and want to become a master as a `full-stack engineer`.

Privately, I am also interested in `work methodology` - how to work quickly and effectively.
