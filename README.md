# About me :sunglasses:

I am a Warsaw University of Technology CS graduate, writing mainly in JavaScript and Python. I love creating frontend & backend applications and want to become a master as a full-stack engineer. Currently, I am studying project management at Kozminski University.

Privately, I am also interested in work methodology - how to work quickly and effectively.
